# Bank Deposit Decision Expert

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Bank Deposit Decision Expert. The system is designed to make predictions related to bank deposits based on a trained machine learning model.

## Files

- **app.py:** Python script for running the application.
- **Bank_Deposit_Decision_Expert.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the main code and analysis.
- **bank-additional-full.csv:** Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **model.sav:** Saved machine learning model using a serialized format.
- **README.md:** Documentation file providing information about the project.
- **tfidf_vect_train_dict.pickle:** Pickle file containing the TF-IDF vectorizer trained on the dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bank_Deposit_Decision_Expert.git

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py

## Usage

- The app.py script serves as the entry point for the Bank Deposit Decision Expert application.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (Bank_Deposit_Decision_Expert.ipynb) for a detailed walkthrough of the code and analysis.

## Model

- The machine learning model is saved in model.sav and can be loaded for making predictions.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided in bank-additional-full.csv.

## Additional Information

- The TF-IDF vectorizer used in the model is stored in tfidf_vect_train_dict.pickle.
